hey it's josephine from the point shop i am at dance medical in san diego and you

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,599
have been loving our instagram reels so i wanted to give you some background

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,599
story on one of the reels that i made while i was fitting so this dancer came

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,400
in with the longest most beautiful legs gorgeous gorgeous feet and she was

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,240
telling me that she was in a professional ballet company and she's

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,960
still having trouble articulating her feet and getting over her box i had her

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,920
put on her current point shoes and she clearly wasn't getting over the box

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,160
and it was also twisting a lot she grew up in a professional ballet school which

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,600
means that it's a ballet school that's connected with a professional company

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,160
and a lot of these schools have certain brands that they really like so this

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,280
dancer grew up wearing just one type of brand if you're just flexible and not

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,719
strong you may not be able to get over on your point shoes if you're just

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,039
strong and not flexible then you may not get on point but this girl had

14
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,720
everything so what is the problem here this dancer has really wide feet and a

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,880
really high profile so there was just a lot of volume in her foot the point

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,000
shoes that she was in unfortunately doesn't come in wider widths so the

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,040
widest width in that particular brand just wasn't wide enough for her we tried

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
a brand that was two widths wider than what she was in and she was able to get

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,159
over beautifully she was able to balance really well and she's strong enough and

20
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,880
that's how we get her over her point shoes a lot of people come into

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,600
our point you fitting with a solution they say that i think the vamp is too

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,840
short or i think the shank is too soft or the shank is too hard you have to

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,720
come in with the problem because the solution may be different for every

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,960
single person you might not be getting over your box too but you may have

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,280
completely different reasons why you're not getting over a lot of people when

26
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,640
they see that they're not getting over your point shoes they keep giving you

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
softer shoes because it's easier to bend and that's

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,079
that works most of the time but it could also be because the vamp is too short

29
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,479
the crown is too low the shoe is too narrow the shoe is too tapered the shoe

30
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,040
is too hard the shoe is too soft i mean there's a million different reasons why

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,280
you may not be getting over your box and for this particular dancer that wasn't

32
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,599
the solution at all it almost didn't matter how soft or how hard the shoes

33
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,599
were we just had to figure out the shape of the shoe and once we're able to

34
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,000
figure out the shape then we were able to get her over on their box sometimes

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,360
it's just as simple as going for a wider width if the shoe doesn't fit width-wise

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,840
then it might pull you back and this girl is a professional dancer at a very

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,319
prestigious contemporary ballet company she had to get to this level to figure

38
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,920
out that her shoes didn't fit so whenever you have a problem don't come

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,000
into your fitter with the solution tell them what your problems are we'll try to

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,599
figure out the best solution for you

41
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,840
